# Getting Started

Welcome to My Library App! (frontend)


A B O U T
=========
My Wardrobe is a Single Page Application built with React on the frontend and Ruby on the backend. With this application you will be able to:

- see all the books in your library
- add new books, authors or genres to your library
- delete or edit books in your library
- search books by title
- like books (This feature doesn't have backend persistence)
- keep track of how many books you have in your library and how many of those books are unread
- see the book with the most page
- see the newest book in your library


C O N T E X T
=========
This app was created as part of my portfolio project for Flatiron School, Software Engineer Bootcamp. The project was required to follow the following:

1- Use Active Record to interact with a database.

2- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.

3- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:

    - create and read actions for both models

    - full CRUD capability for one of the models: The update action should be implemented using a form that is pre-filled with existing values for the object. On submission of the form, the object should update. Note: Using a like button or similar will not meet the update requirement.

4- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.

5- Implement proper front end state management. You should be updating state using a setState function after receiving your response from a POST, PATCH, or DELETE request. You should NOT be relying on a GET request to update state.

6- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.

7- Routes in your application (both client side and back end) should follow RESTful conventions.

8- Use your back end optimally. Pass JSON for related associations to the front end from the back end. You should use active record methods in your controller to grab the needed data from your database and provide as JSON to the front end. You should NOT be relying on filtering front end state or a separate fetch request to retrieve related data.
